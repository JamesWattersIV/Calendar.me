### Firebase Authentication
The App includes firebase authentication for user login and registeration.

### Cloud Firestore
Events that a user has added or removed from their calendar are saved in a Firestore database. Therefore logging in between devices ensures calender events are accessible.

### To-Do
The Daily To-Do list allows a user to add, complete and removes items that they need to complete. It is intended for a simple look at what a user needs to complete on a given day.

### Calendar and Daily Events
The calendar screen shows the user what events they have on a given day. The calendar itself shows the user the current date, is scrollable, and when a specific date is selected, the events on that day are loaded.

### Events Page
This page shows what events the user has in the up coming week. Additionally this is where events are added and removed from the calendar.
